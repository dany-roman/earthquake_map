# 30 Days of Earthquakes Map

## Background

Create a map of the most recent earthquakes using leaflet, javascript, and html



## Approach

1.  Imported the last 30 days of earthquakes from the USGS GeoJSON feed
2.  Collected coordinate locations
3. Assigned a marker color based on earthquake depth/altitude (km)
4. Used magnitude as the radius of the earthquake marker
5. Plotted on a leaflet map
